| Feature                    | **List**                                                                                                                              | **Tuple**                                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mutability**             | Mutable (can be changed after creation)                                                                                               | Immutable (cannot be changed after creation)          |
| **Memory layout**          | Contiguous memory                                                                                                                     | Not guaranteed to be contiguous                       |
| **Index access time**      | **O(1)**                                                                                                                              | **O(1)**                                              |
| **Reason for O(1) access** | As it is contiguous in memory, Python calculates the element’s address directly:<br>`address = start_address + (index * object_size)` | Same direct access due to fixed size and immutability |
| **Insertion/Deletion**     | **O(n)** — inserting or deleting shifts elements to maintain order                                                                    | Not possible (tuple is immutable)                     |
| **Usage**                  | When data needs modification, dynamic operations                                                                                      | When data is fixed and should not change              |
| **Syntax**                 | `[1, 2, 3]`                                                                                                                           | `(1, 2, 3)`                                           |
| **Memory efficiency**      | Slightly larger (due to dynamic nature)                                                                                               | More memory efficient                                 |
| **Hashable**               | ❌ No (unhashable, can’t be dict key)                                                                                                 | ✅ Yes (if elements are also hashable)                |
